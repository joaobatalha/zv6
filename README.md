ZV6: A Fork of MIT's XV6, inspired by ZFS
===

Final project for [MIT's Operating System Engineering class](http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828). The project goal was to modify the [XV6](http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2012/xv6.html) operating system (itself based on Unix V6) to support ZFS-like file systems features. Namely, we modified XV6 to suport inode-checksums and 'ditto blocks' to replace corrupted files on the spot.
